HoldOut is a simple game, inspired by [Chicanery](http://chicanery.auntiepixelante.com/) by Anna Anthropy.  

The goal is simple: be the last person to keep your Blink alive.

## SETUP

Each player gets 1 tile.  Pressing the tile's button once will flash a randomized color, indicating it's ready for the round.  Pressing the button again begins the round.

After a tile "dies", it can be reset for the next round by double-clicking.  Like before, it will flash with a new randomized color to indicate that it's ready for play.

## GAMEPLAY

Each Blink only has 1 second of life.  Press your Blink's button to give it another second.  

Keep your Blink alive... __by any means necessary__.

## WIN CONDITION

The winner is the last player to keep their Blink alive.  Double clicking the tile's button after it's light fades will return it to the "ready" state.
