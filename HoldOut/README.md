HoldOut is a game with a more physical playstyle, inspired by [Chicanery](http://chicanery.auntiepixelante.com/) by Anna Anthropy and [J.S. Joust](jsjoust.com) by Die Gute Fabrik.  

The goal is simple: be the last player alive.

## SETUP

Each player gets 1 tile.  Arrange your tiles into line, a ring, or any other pattern that would be easy to pull apart.  Separating all tiles or pressing a tile's button once will flash a randomized color, indicating it's ready for the round.  Pressing the button again begins the round.


## GAMEPLAY

Your Blink only has 1 second of life.  Press your Blink's button to reset the 1-second lifespan.

A dead blink may be revived by being reconnected to a live blink, a flashing light indicating it's alive and ready to seperate and keep playing.

Keep your Blink alive... ***__by any means necessary__***.

## WIN CONDITION

Be the last player or team alive!
