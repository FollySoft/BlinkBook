###### By Jonathan West

| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 2 - 12            | 2 - 12             |  ~ 5-10 minutes    | 12 & Up          |

HoldOut is a simple game, inspired by self-effacing games like [Chicanery](http://chicanery.auntiepixelante.com/) by Anna Anthropy and [B.U.T.T.O.N](https://gutefabrik.com/button.html) by Die Gute Fabrik.  

The goal is simple: be the last person to keep your Blink alive.

## SETUP

Each player gets 1 tile.  Pressing the tile's button once will flash a randomized color, indicating it's ready for the round.  Pressing the button again begins the round.

## GAMEPLAY

Each Blink only has 1 second of life.  Press your Blink's button to give it another second.  

Keep your Blink alive... __by any means necessary__.

## WIN CONDITION

The winner is the last person to keep their Blink alive.  Double clicking the tile's button after it's light fades will return it to the "ready" state.
