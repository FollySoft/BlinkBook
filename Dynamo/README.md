# Dynamo - A Blinks Project
###### By Jonathan West


A Dynamo is a device for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.  Only by pressing the button can you keep the lights on and the machine alive.  Use Dynamo to play Blinks games, or try making your own!

## GAME: "Power Struggle"

### RULES
| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 2 +           | 2 +             |  ~ 5-10 minutes    | 12 & Up          |

Power Struggle is a simple, physical game, played with Dynamo Blinks.
Power is scarce, and you must fight to keep the lights on.  The goal is simple: be the last person to keep your dynamo alive and operational.

#### SETUP
Distribute 1 Dynamo Blink to each player.  Players should place their tiles on a table or other flat playing surface, keeping 1 finger on their tile.
For a more intense game, try playing without a flat surface.  But play nice! Blinks are tough, but not unbreakable!

### GAMEPLAY
Players begin the game by activating their dynamos at the same time with a button press.  Your dynamo’s light will start to fade, indicating its power level.  But act fast! Your dynamo only has about one second of life! 
Press your dynamo’s button to give it more power and reset it’s lifespan.  If your power level fades to zero, you’re knocked out of the round.

Keep your dynamo alive... by any means necessary!  

### WIN CONDITION
The winner of the round is the last player to keep their dynamo alive and operational.  
After a dynamo dies, it can be reset for the next round with a double-click.  It will glow with a new randomized color to indicate that it's ready for play.

## GAME: "Bulb Juggler"
### RULES
| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 2 +           | 2 +             |  ~ 5-10 minutes    | 12 & Up          |
Bulb Juggler is played using Dynamo Blinks.  You are a street-performer, and juggling lightbulbs is your bread and butter.  Try to keep as many of your light bulbs lit as you can before dropping one!

### SETUP
Gather Dynamo Blinks, or “light bulbs”, together into a group and make sure they are all in the “ready” state.  

You can also play with a friend by starting with one light bulb having them pass you additional bulbs while you play.

### GAMEPLAY
Start the round by pressing any one bulb’s button.  It’s light will start to fade, indicating its power level.  Each bulb only has about one second of life - press a light bulb’s button to give it power and reset the one-second lifespan.

Continue to add more light bulbs to the game as you play, pressing their buttons to keep them alive.  If any of your lights fade completely, the game has ended.

### WIN CONDITION
The game ends when at least one bulb dies.  Keep count of how many you can keep alive before any of your lights go out.

## GAME: "Current"
| Number of Blinks | Number of Players | Duration of Gameplay | Recommended Ages |
|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 1 +           | 2 +             |  ~ 5-10 minutes    | 12 & Up          |

Current is a “hot potato” meets “egg toss” style game for 2 or more players, using Dynamo Blinks.  Pass electrons back and forth, keeping the current flowing before losing the charge!

### SETUP
Players sit around a table or across from each other. Assign one Dynamo Blink, or electron, to a “starting player”.  

For added complexity, try letting additional players start with electrons.

### GAMEPLAY
The starting player presses the button on their tile to start the one second timer. When ready, the starting player passes it along to the next player either next to them or across from them.
Players continue to pass their blinks back and forth until it dies.  

The player responsible for letting the electron die is knocked out of the game. The player nearest to the knocked out player may pick up the electron, reset the charge with a double click, and pass it along to continue the game.

### WIN CONDITION
The game ends when only one player is left standing.  The last player to keep the tile(s) alive is the winner!

If only playing with 2, players may alternatively pass the tile back and forth, keeping track of how many passes they make before their tile’s life runs out.
